# Personal Profile

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham. I am in the final stages of obtaining a PhD at the University of Southampton. My research interests include gravitational waves produced by astrophysical systems and how to model them in General Relativity and alternative theories of gravity. I have made significant progress towards modelling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, a key source for LISA science. Specifically, I have formulated second-order self-force methods in Kerr and have a leading role in implementing a second-order Teukolsky scheme in Schwarzschild.


# Occupation

* Reasearch Fellow at the University of Nottingham, 2022-


# Education

* Ph.D in Applied Mathematics at the University of Southampton, 2018-2022

* Msci in Physics at Durham University 2013-2017 


# Teaching, Outreach, and Organising Experience
  
* Since December 2022, I am the co-chair of the Capra Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committee.

* During my PhD, I have had regular teaching responsibilities in maths, engineering, and physics courses, including assisting seminar leaders, one-to-one guided learning, and marking coursework.

* I organise a seminar series at Southampton with invited speakers from across the global self-force community.

* At Southampton's 2022 science and engineering festival I joint organised a stall where visitors fell into a black hole (virtually).

* At the 2019 STAG public lecture outreach event, I was part of a team helping school pupils complete physics experiments. 

* In 2018 I assisted a physics class at Richard Taunton Sixth Form College, where I discussed the experience of studying physics at university with potential future students. 

* I am a member of the LISA Consortium.
