## Personal Profile

I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at University College Dublin. I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Southampton. I model astrophysical systems, such as black hole binaries, and the gravitational waves they produce. I am an expert in developing methods in black hole perturbation theory to tackle self-force and quasi-normal mode problems in general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.

## Occupation

* Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at University College Dublin, 2025-

* Reasearch Fellow at the University of Nottingham, 2022-2025


## Education

* Ph.D in Applied Mathematics at the University of Southampton, 2018-2022

* Msci in Physics at Durham University 2013-2017 


## Teaching, Outreach, and Organising Experience
  
* In 2023, I was the co-chair of the Capra Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committee.

* During my PhD, I have had regular teaching responsibilities in maths, engineering, and physics courses, including assisting seminar leaders, one-to-one guided learning, and marking coursework.

* I organise a seminar series at Southampton with invited speakers from across the global self-force community.

* At Southampton's 2022 science and engineering festival I joint organised a stall where visitors fell into a black hole (virtually).

* At the 2019 STAG public lecture outreach event, I was part of a team helping school pupils complete physics experiments. 

* In 2018 I assisted a physics class at Richard Taunton Sixth Form College, where I discussed the experience of studying physics at university with potential future students. 

* I am a member of the LISA Consortium.

* I co-coordinate a project within the LISA Consortium, organising a team of 15 researchers.
