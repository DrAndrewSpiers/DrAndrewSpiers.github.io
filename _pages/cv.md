## Personal Profile

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham and PhD graduate from the University of Southampton. I develop methods in black hole perturbation theory to tackle self-force and quasi-normal mode problems in general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. My endeavour is to be a world leader in producing models for waveform templates used in future gravitational wave data analysis.

## Occupation

* Reasearch Fellow at the University of Nottingham, 2022-


## Education

* Ph.D in Applied Mathematics at the University of Southampton, 2018-2022

* Msci in Physics at Durham University 2013-2017 


## Teaching, Outreach, and Organising Experience
  
* In 2023, I was the co-chair of the Capra Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committee.

* During my PhD, I have had regular teaching responsibilities in maths, engineering, and physics courses, including assisting seminar leaders, one-to-one guided learning, and marking coursework.

* I organise a seminar series at Southampton with invited speakers from across the global self-force community.

* At Southampton's 2022 science and engineering festival I joint organised a stall where visitors fell into a black hole (virtually).

* At the 2019 STAG public lecture outreach event, I was part of a team helping school pupils complete physics experiments. 

* In 2018 I assisted a physics class at Richard Taunton Sixth Form College, where I discussed the experience of studying physics at university with potential future students. 

* I am a member of the LISA Consortium.
