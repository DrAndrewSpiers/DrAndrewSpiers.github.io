Welcome to my webpage, here I will provide exciting updates on my research. Currtently, the website is in the making, so much aof the content needs edditing.

How deep does the rabbit hole go?
======
I have recently submitted my thesis and will be examined in early September. I am excited to share the preamble of my thesis with you shortly. During my time at Southampton I have been wroking on methods for moddeling black hole binaries in General Relativity with Adam Pound.

In September I will start a Research Associate role at the University of Nottingham, where I will work on modelling bienaries in alternative theories of gravity with Thomas Sotiriou.

I am also a visitor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Nico Yunes, and will join his group to start a Postdoc in two years time.
