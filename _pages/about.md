Welcome to my webpage, here I provide exciting updates on my research into how black holes curve space and time and the gravitational waves they produce. 

How deep does the rabbit hole go?
======
From 2018-2022, I completed my PhD at the University of Southampton under the supervision of Dr. Adam Pound. My thesis was in modelling black hole binaries using black hole perturbation theory. To read a summary of my research there, please read my [Blog Post](https://drandrewspiers.github.io//posts/2012/08/blog-post-2/). 

From 2022-2025 I was a Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham with Prof. Thomas Sotiriou and the Nottingham Centre of Gravity. There I expanded my expertise by applying black hole binary modelling techniques to alternative theories of gravity to general relativity.

In October 2025, I began a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship, under the mentorship of Dr. Niels Warburton. I continue to work on the cutting edge of black hole binary modelling using perturbation theory, both in general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.
