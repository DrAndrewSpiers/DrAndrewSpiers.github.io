Welcome to my webpage; here, I will provide exciting updates on my research. Currently, the website is in the making, so much of the content needs editing.

How deep does the rabbit hole go?
======
I recently submitted my thesis, which will be examined in early September. I am excited to share the preamble of my thesis with you shortly. At Southampton, I worked on methods for modelling black hole binaries in General Relativity with Adam Pound.

I will start a Research Associate role in September at the University of Nottingham. At Nottingham, I will work on modelling binaries in alternative theories of gravity with Thomas Sotiriou.

I am also a visitor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Nico Yunes. I will join his group to start a Postdoc in 2024.
