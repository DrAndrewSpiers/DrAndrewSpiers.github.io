Welcome to my webpage, here I provide exciting updates on my research into how black holes curve space and time and the gravitational waves they produce. 

How deep does the rabbit hole go?
======
From 2018-2022, I completed my PhD at the University of Southampton in modelling black hole binaries under the supervision of Dr. Adam Pound. To read a summary of my research there, please read my [Blog Post](https://drandrewspiers.github.io//posts/2012/08/blog-post-2/). 

In September 2022 I started a Research Associate role at the University of Nottingham, where I work on modelling binaries in alternative theories of gravity with Prof. Thomas Sotiriou and his group.

I am also a visitor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. Nico Yunes, and will join his group to start a Postdoc in 2024.
